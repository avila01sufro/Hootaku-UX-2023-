## 1. Introduction

Consuming anime and manga has become a more mainstream hobby in recent years, but with the rise of the medium, finding exciting new stories andd tracking the chapters and episodes of a particular series is becoming increasingly difficult among the sea of content available.

This project is focused on automatizing this aspect of the hobby in an approachable and simplified manner.

## 2. Strategy

To have a more structured plan for the project, we have used a 'Value proposition canvas', so our view is focused and has a solid foundation.

In this canvas we analyze the problems our application is tackling, how we will approach said problems, and a strategical analyisis of the required functions we will need.
